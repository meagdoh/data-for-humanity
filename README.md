# Data for Humanity – A Data Storytelling Card Game

**Data for Humanity** is an interactive, card-based game designed to help anyone explore and use open data—especially people who feel they are “not good with numbers.”  
The game encourages players to turn data points into compelling stories and discover the power of open data in everyday life.

## Background

Open data is a powerful public resource, yet many people are unaware of how to use it or even that it exists.  
**Data for Humanity** introduces open data in a friendly, playful format that welcomes:

- Students  
- Designers and design agencies  
- Educators and librarians  
- Journalists and nonprofit employees  
- Government staff  
- Storytellers, activists, and community advocates  

The game helps participants build comfort with concepts like percentages, comparisons, and data-driven insights—without needing technical skills.

Developed by **Meag Doherty** as part of a Mozilla Foundation Open Leaders initiative, the game is loosely inspired by *Cards Against Humanity* and serves as a hands-on tool for data literacy.

## How the Game Works

The game is played in rounds using two decks of cards:

- **Prompt Cards (P)** – storytelling prompts  
- **Data Cards (D)** – real data facts or values  

---

### Game Setup

- Place both decks at the center of the table.  
- Each player draws **7 cards**.  
- Select a **Data Czar** for the first round (e.g., the person with the most recent birthday).

---

### Gameplay

1. The Data Czar draws a **Prompt Card** and reads it aloud.  
2. All other players choose a card (or cards) from their hand that best completes or answers the prompt.  
3. Players submit their chosen card(s) face-down to the Data Czar.  
4. The Data Czar shuffles the submissions, reads each response aloud, and selects the story they find most compelling.  
5. The winning player keeps the card(s) they submitted as points.

---

### Next Round

- Choose a new Data Czar.  
- All players draw cards until they again have **3 Data Cards**.  
- Continue until the group decides to end the session.  
- The player with the most collected cards wins the game.

---

## Game Content

The decks include themes and facts sourced from public datasets such as **NYC Open Data**.  
Some cards are intentionally left blank so players can create new prompts or data points, encouraging creativity and customization.
